<h1>LORD SHIVA</h1>
<p>Sivan, also known as Lord Shiva, is one of the principal deities in Hinduism and is especially revered in South India, where he is commonly referred to by his Tamil name, Sivan. He is part of the Hindu trinity, alongside Brahma the creator and Vishnu the preserver, with Shiva being the destroyer and transformer. Far from being a negative force, his role is to destroy evil, ego, and ignorance, making way for new growth and transformation. Lord Sivan is often depicted with a third eye on his forehead, symbolizing wisdom and inner vision, and he carries a trident called the trishula. He wears a snake around his neck, sits in meditation or dances the cosmic dance (Nataraja), and rides a sacred bull named Nandi. His divine consort is Goddess Parvati, and their children include Lord Ganesha and Lord Murugan (Kartikeya). Temples dedicated to Sivan can be found across India, especially in Tamil Nadu, where he is deeply worshipped through rituals, chants, and festivals like Maha Shivaratri.</p>
